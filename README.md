# Craftingkatze Home

This repository hosts my website where I test different experiments, ideas, and small projects.

The site serves as a technical playground for trying out new web development concepts. Here I experiment with layouts, designs, JavaScript functionality, and other web features before integrating them into larger projects.

The repository contains the static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related assets) and is deployed using GitHub Pages.
